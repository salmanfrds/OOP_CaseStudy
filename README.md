Welcome to our group’s program! We have created a payroll management system that allows the user (manager) to access the program and calculate the employees’ salaries. The system has four main features:

1. Register Employee
2. Check-in and Check-out of employee working time
3. Calculate employees’ salary per work hour
4. Track record of the employee’s recent working hours (first 22 working hours)

Welcome to our group’s program! We have created a payroll management system that allows the user (manager) to access the program and calculate the employees’ salaries. The system has four main features:

1. Register Employee
2. Check-in and Check-out of employee working time
3. Calculate employees’ salary per work hour
4. Track record of the employee’s recent working hours (first 22 working hours)

The class diagram will be provided in I-taleem.m
